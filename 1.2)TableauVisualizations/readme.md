# ðŸŒ³ Urban Trees Maintained by Calgary Parks  
Dataset can be found under:  
(Images/dataset.csv) 


## Overview  
This dataset provides a comprehensive look into **Calgaryâ€™s urban forestry management**, focusing on trees and shrubs that are **actively maintained by the City of Calgaryâ€™s Parks and Urban Forestry Business Units**. Each record represents an individual tree asset, including details about its **species**, **genus**, **size (DBH)**, **health rating**, **appraised monetary value**, **maintenance activity**, and **geographic location**.  

Urban trees play a vital role in improving air quality, providing shade, enhancing biodiversity, and increasing property values. By maintaining an extensive database of these assets, the City of Calgary ensures a balance between **aesthetic urban design**, **environmental sustainability**, and **public safety**.  

The primary purpose of this visualization project is to use data storytelling to understand:  
- Which **tree species and genera dominate Calgaryâ€™s parks and neighborhoods**,  
- How **tree size and health (condition ratings)** relate to **appraised value**,  
- What **maintenance activities** (such as pruning, establishment, and stump removal) are most common, and  
- How the City distributes its **urban forestry resources** to preserve long-term canopy health.  

Through a series of Tableau visualizations, this dataset highlights spatial, biological, and economic patterns that reveal the scale and structure of Calgaryâ€™s managed green infrastructure. The findings provide insights not only into tree diversity but also into how **urban planning and ecological maintenance intersect** in one of Canadaâ€™s fastest-growing municipalities.

## Insights
- Healthy trees are concentrated in major Calgary parks, with most mature trees showing strong condition ratings and only a few lower-health clusters near high-traffic areas.
- Poplar and Spruce trees hold the highest appraised values, indicating their importance to Calgaryâ€™s overall urban canopy and long-term maintenance focus.
- Deciduous trees such as Poplar, Elm, and Willow display the widest trunk diameters (DBH), showing a mix of younger and heritage trees across city parks.
- Spruce and Poplar dominate Calgaryâ€™s maintained tree inventory, making up the largest share of actively managed species in the dataset.
Genera with larger tree populations also show higher median appraised values, revealing a strong link between maintenance investment and ecological value.
