# Data Visualization Portfolio  
*A portfolio of multi-tool visualizations that bring data to life*  

## ðŸ“Š About  
This repository showcases a collection of data visualizations Iâ€™ve created using different tools and techniques. Each project focuses on transforming datasets into clear, insightful, and visually engaging stories.  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** â€“ Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Tableau / Power BI** â€“ interactive dashboards and reports  
- **R (ggplot2)** â€“ statistical and exploratory visualizations  
- **JavaScript / D3.js** â€“ web-based interactive graphics
- **Microsoft Excel** - exploratory graphics

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights  
- Demonstrates versatility across multiple platforms and libraries.  
- Combines technical accuracy with design principles for effective storytelling.  
- Focused on making insights accessible to technical and non-technical audiences.  

## ðŸ“‚ Projects  
Each folder in this repository contains:  
- The dataset (or reference to its source).  
- The code or files used to generate the visualization.  
- The final visualization output (image, dashboard, or interactive graphic).  

## ðŸš€ Future Work  
I plan to continue expanding this portfolio with new visualizations, exploring emerging tools, and experimenting with interactive, web-based data storytelling.
